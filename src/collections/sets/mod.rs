//! A struct that implements `Set` is assumed to hold a collection of values, however the
//! collection itself does not have to be explicit. Items of a `Set` can be even uncountable.
//!
//! Because Rust currently does not have a `Set` trait (and even if it had, its use case would
//! probably differ from ours), we introduce our own `Set` trait. As an example implementation,
//! see `ExplicitSet` which simply delegates to rust `HashSet`.
//!
//! Basic set-like operations are provided:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use biodivine_lib_std::collections::sets::{ExplicitSet, Set};
//! let a = ExplicitSet::new_with_items(vec!["a", "b", "hello"]);
//! let b = ExplicitSet::new_with_items(vec!["hello", "my", "darling"]);
//! let i = ExplicitSet::new_with_items(vec!["hello"]);
//! assert!(!a.is_empty());
//! assert!(!a.is_subset(&b));
//! assert!(!a.is_subset(&i));
//! assert!(a.is_subset(&a.union(&b)));
//! assert_eq!(i, a.intersect(&b));
//! ```
//!
//! ### Set elements and iteration
//!
//! Our sets don't have to be countable (or contain instantiable elements
//! for that matter). However, some sets are (and some algorithms require this). We therefore
//! also provide `ElementSet` trait which defines what type of elements appear in the sets and
//! allows *testing for their presence* or *picking a single representing element*:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use biodivine_lib_std::collections::sets::{ExplicitSet, ElementSet, Set};
//! let a = ExplicitSet::new_with_items(vec!["a", "b"]);
//! assert!(a.contains(&"b"));
//! assert!(a.contains(&a.pick().unwrap()));
//! let x = a.pick().unwrap();
//! assert!(x == "a" || x == "b");
//! assert!(ExplicitSet::<i32>::empty().pick().is_none());
//! ```
//!
//! Furthermore, an `ElementSet` can implement `IterableSet` where one can also iterate over
//! all elements in the sets:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use biodivine_lib_std::collections::sets::{ExplicitSet, IterableSet};
//! let a = ExplicitSet::new_with_items(vec!["a", "b"]);
//! for x in a.iter() {
//!     assert!(x == "a" || x == "b");
//! }
//! assert_eq!(2, a.iter().count());
//! ```
