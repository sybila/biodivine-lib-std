//! We consider directed graphs with loops to be our main graph-like structure. Graph can be
//! also extended with edge or vertex labels.
//!
//! ### Evolution operators
//!
//! Compared to most typical representations, we abstract the edge set using a concept of
//! `EvolutionOperator`. This concept is borrowed from the theory of dynamical systems where
//! it usually applies to the evolution of a continuous system.
//!
//! An `EvolutionOperator` is simply a function that accepts a graph `Vertex` and returns
//! an `Iterator` over the successor vertices. The important distinction is that the
//! `EvolutionOperator` does not have to necessarily return "forward" successors, but can
//! also follow the evolution of a graph in the opposite direction.
//!
//! This is useful in several cases:
//!  - For some systems, one cannot construct the actual graph (for example when the vertices
//!  are not known beforehand and are only discovered lazily) â€” in such case, `EvolutionOperator`
//!  can be still implemented and used by most algorithms.
//!  - Some algorithms (for example many forward-backward SSC decompositions) use sub-routines
//!  that are sometimes performed following the edges forward and sometimes backward. These
//!  sub-routines would have to be implemented twice, or use a algorithm-specific abstraction
//!  over the graph (which would probably look very much like the evolution operator anyway).
//!
//! Also, evolution operators can be wrapped in transformations that enable you to implement
//! things like filtering without caring about the graph itself.
//!
//! TODO: Example!
//!
//! ### Edge and vertex labels
//!
//! Often, graphs contain more than the basic vertex-edge structure. To avoid having a specialized
//! trait for every such variant, we consider `EdgeLabels` and `VertexLabels` that facilitate this
//! extra information.
